# Hyperparameter-tuning
Small Artificial Neural Network hyperparameter tuning project  on classification task using KerasClassifier and GridSearchCv. 

The algorithm checks for the optimum hyperparameters to be used to train the model. 
In this project , the hyperparameters whose performance are tested are : --> the the number of hidden layers and how many neurons are on each layer
                                                                         --> activation funtion
